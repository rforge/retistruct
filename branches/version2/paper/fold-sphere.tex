\title{Inference of original retinal coordinates from  flattenend

\begin{abstract}
  In retrograde tracing experiments to determine the mapping of
  connections from the retina to the superior colliculus in mice, a
  small blob of dye is injected in the superior colliculus and allowed
  to diffuse retrogradely down the axons of retinal ganglion cells to
  their cell bodies in the retina. The retina is dissected and
  flattened, and the pattern of dye in cell bodies can be seen in the
  flattened retina.  In the process of flattening the retina, a number
  incisions are made, and the pattern of dye can cut across incisions,
  complicating analysis.  One way of simplifying the analysis would be
  to infer the position of the cell bodies in the spherical coordinate
  system of the intact retina.

\section{Introduction}
\label{fold-sphere:sec:introduction}

The general idea behind this method is to image folding the flattend
retina onto a sphere (or ellipsoid) that has the same dimensions that
would be expected of the real eye. Tears in the retina will naturally
tend to close up as they are folded onto the sphere.  In order to
perform the folding, the method has to allow for some elasticity in
the retina, and also prevent the edges of the flattened retina from
overlapping with each other on the surface of the sphere. The method
as developed so far does incorporate elasticity, but the prevention of
overlap has not yet been implemented.

\section{Algorithm}
\label{fold-retina:sec:method}



\subsection{Triangulation of flattened retina}
\label{fold-sphere:sec:triang-flatt-retina}

\begin{figure}[tp]
  \centering
  %\includegraphics{mesh}
  \caption{Triangular mesh}
  \label{fold-sphere:fig:mesh}
\end{figure}

The edge of the flattend retina is described by a set of $N$ points:
$\mathcal{P} = \{\vec{p}_1,\dots,\vec{p}_N$\}. Connections between
points are represented by forwards and backwards pointers, which are
represented as vectors $\vec{g}^+$ and $\vec{g}^-$:
\begin{displaymath}
  g^+_i = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      i+1 & i < N \\
      1   & i = N
    \end{array}\right.
  \quad
  g^-_i = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      i-1 & i > 1 \\
      N   & i = 1
    \end{array}\right.
\end{displaymath}

A triangular mesh with the set of points $\mathcal{P}$ as its boundary
is created using the conforming Delaunay triangulation algorithm
provided by the Triangle package \citep{shewchuk96b}. By summing the
areas of the triangles in this rough triangulation, the total area $A$
of the retina is computed. The retina is then triangulated again into
at least $n=200$ triangles, by using the conforming Delaunay
triangulation with the additional constraint that each triangle should
by no larger than $A/n$, and and with Ruppert's
\todo{Reference for Ruppert} method for ensuring the smallest angle of
any triangle is no less than $20^\circ$.

The triangulation comprises $M$ triangles and is described by an
$M\times3$ matrix $\mathbf{T}$, where each row contains the indicies
of the points in the triangle in anticlockwise order.

The area $a_i$ of each triangle is computed:
\begin{displaymath}
  a_i = |0.5 (\vec{p}_{T_{i2}}-\vec{p}_{T_{i1}})\times
  (\vec{p}_{T_{i3}}-\vec{p}_{T_{i2}})|
\end{displaymath}

\begin{enumerate}
\item From the triangluation $\mathbf{T}$ the set $\mathcal{C}$ of pairs of
  indicies representing line segments is constructed.
\item For the morphing algorithm, it is essential that no line segment
  connects non-adjacent nodes in the rim $\mathcal{R}$. Such line
  segments may be created by the triangulation. To detect such line
  segments, each member of $\mathcal{C}$ is checked to see if it is a
  subset of $\mathcal{R}$ and that its ends are not adjacent, by
  using $g^+$ and $g^-$. For each line segment that is found, it is
  removed by
  \begin{itemize}
  \item removing the two triangles that it belongs to from the list
    $\mathbf{T}$
  \item Creating a new point at the centroid of the four verticies
    shared by these two triangles. This new point $i$ is added to the
    correspondences vector: $h_i=i$.
  \item Creating four new triangles, who all share the new point and
    the each of which has two verticies from the set of four
    triangles.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The connection set is converted into $\mathbf{C}$, a symmetric,
binary-valued matrix that defines if there is a connection between $i$
and $j$.  

The distances $L_{ij}$ are between grid points on the flattened retina
are computed.

\subsection{Stitching algorithm}
\label{fold-sphere:sec:stitching-algorithm}

\begin{figure}[tp]
  \centering
  %\includegraphics{stitch}  
  \caption{Stitching. The solid line is the outline of the retina. The
    red circled-points are ones that were originally on the rim. The
    blue lines are the + tears and the purple lines are the - tears.
    Green lines indicate corresponding verticies at the end of tears.
    Yellow lines indicate corresponding points along the tears. }
  \label{fold-sphere:fig:stitch}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:stitch} shows a flattened
retina which has had the stitching algorithm applied to it. 

Cuts and tears marked up by an expert.  Each of the $M$ cuts or tears
$j$ is defined by a common apex at the point indexed by $A_j$, a
vertex in the forwards direction (indexed by $V^+_j$) and in the
backwards directions (indexed by $V^-_j$).  Pairs of verticies will
correspond to each other in the morphed retina, and this relationship
is indicated by a correspondence vectors $\vec{h}^+$ and $\vec{h}^-$:
\begin{displaymath}
  h^+_i =  \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      i & \mbox{ if } i \not\in \{V^-_1,\dots, V^-_M\} \\
      V^+_j  & \mbox{ if } \exists j: i = V^-_j
    \end{array}\right.
  \quad
  h^-_i =  \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      i & \mbox{ if } i \not\in \{V^+_1,\dots, V^+_M\} \\
      V^-_j  & \mbox{ if } \exists j: i = V^+_j
    \end{array}\right.
\end{displaymath}
At this stage, a correpondence vector $\vec{h}$ is initialiased to be
the same as $\vec{h}^+$.

The set of points in each tear is determined using the function
$\mathrm{path}$:
\begin{displaymath}
  \mathrm{path}(i, j, \vec{g}, \vec{h})  = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \{i\} & \mbox{ if } i = j \\
      \{i, \mathrm{path}(g_i, j, \vec{g}, \vec{h})\} & \mbox{ if } i \ne j, h_i=i \\
      \{i, \mathrm{path}(h_i, j, \vec{g}, \vec{h})\}    & \mbox{ if } i \ne j, h_i\ne i \\
    \end{array}\right.
\end{displaymath}
This allows us to write:
\begin{displaymath}
  \mathcal{T}^+_j  = \mathrm{path}(A_j, V_j^+, \vec{g}^+, \vec{h}^+) \quad 
  \mathcal{T}^-_j  = \mathrm{path}(A_j, V_j^-, \vec{g}^-, \vec{h}^-)
\end{displaymath}
It is useful to determine the set of points $\mathcal{R}$ on the rim
of the retina.
\begin{displaymath}
  \mathcal{R} = \{1,\dots,N\} 
  \setminus (\mathcal{T}^+_1 \setminus V^+_1) 
  \setminus (\mathcal{T}^-_1 \setminus V^-_1)  
  \dots 
  \setminus (\mathcal{T}^+_M \setminus V^+_M)
  \setminus (\mathcal{T}^-_M \setminus V^-_M)
\end{displaymath}

The function $\mathrm{pl}$ defines the path length from one point to another
point:
\begin{displaymath}
  \mathrm{pl}(i, j, \vec{g}, \vec{h}, \mathcal{P}) = \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll}
      0 & \mbox{ if } i = j \\
      |\vec{p}_i-\vec{p}_{g_i}| + \mathrm{pl}(g_i, j, \vec{g}, \vec{h}, \mathcal{P}) & \mbox{ if } i \ne j, h_i=i \\
      \mathrm{pl}(h_i, j, \vec{g}, \vec{h}, \mathcal{P})    & \mbox{ if } i \ne j, h_i\ne i \\
    \end{array}\right.
\end{displaymath}
For each tear, the length of each side of the tear is computed:
\begin{displaymath}
  S^+_j = \mathrm{pl}(A_j, V^+_j, \vec{g}^+, \vec{h}^+, \mathcal{P}) \quad 
  S^-_j = \mathrm{pl}(A_j, V^-_j, \vec{g}^-, \vec{h}^-, \mathcal{P})
\end{displaymath}
Then for each point $i$ on the $+$ side of the tear for which there is
no corresponding point $h_i^-$, a new, corresponding, point, with the
index $n=N+1$ is placed at the same fractional distance along the
corresponding $-$ tear. To do this, the distance of a point
$i\in{\mathcal{T}^+_j}\setminus A_j \setminus V^+_j$ along the + tear
is computed:
\begin{displaymath}
  s^+_{ji} = \mathrm{pl}(A_j, i, \vec{g}^+, \vec{h}^+, \mathcal{P}) \quad 
\end{displaymath}
The node $k$ in the corresponding tear is the node which has the node
with the highest fractional distance $s^-_{jk}=\mathrm{pl}(A_j, k,
\vec{g}^-, \vec{h}^-, \mathcal{P})$ along the - tear which is still below
$s^+_{ji}$. The location of the new point is
\begin{displaymath}
  \vec{p}_n = (1-f)\vec{p}_k + f\vec{p}_{g^-_k}
\end{displaymath}
where
\begin{displaymath}
  f = \frac{s^+_{ji}S^-_j/S^+_j-s^-_{jk}}{s^-_{jg^-_k}-s^-_{jk}}
\end{displaymath}
The correspondnaces vector is updated so that $h_i = n$. The vector of
forward pointers is updated so that
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    g^-_n = k     & g^+_n = g^+_k \\
    g^-_{g^+_k} = n & g^+_k = n 
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
If a correspondance $h^-_i$ exists for point $i$, then no new point is
made, but this point is set to correspond to the same point as $h^-_i$
corresponds to by setting $h_i = h_{h^-_i}$. 

A similar procecudure is carried out for the $-$ tear.

After this procedure, it is possible that there may be chains of
correspondences where, for example, $i$ corresponds to $h_i$ and $h_i$
correspondes to a different point $h_{h_i}$. These three points are in
fact actually one, but to indicate this, both $h_i$ and $i$ should
point to $h_{h_i}$.  It order to ensure this, the correspondance
vector is updated iteratively:
\begin{displaymath}
  h^{k+1}_i = h^k_{h^k_i}  
\end{displaymath}
until all $h^{k+1}_i = h^k_i$. The final $\vec{h}^{k+1}$ is referred
to as $\vec{h}$.

% correspondances between points on cuts and tears using an algorithm

\subsection{Projection onto hemisphere}
\label{fold-sphere:sec:proj-onto-hemisph}

When the points are projected onto the hemisphere, the points which
have the stitching algorithm has identified as corresponding with each
other are merged.  This proceeds in a number of steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item A vector $\vec{u}$ of the unique values of $\vec{h}$ is
  formed. This vector has $\tilde N$ elements.
\item A new mapping $\tilde{\vec{h}}$ from the existing indicies to a
  new set of unique indices is formed:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \tilde h_i = j:u_j = h_i
  \end{displaymath}
\item A transformed triangulation $\tilde{\mathbf{T}}$ is derived from
  $\mathbf{T}$, by setting $\tilde{T}_{ij} = \tilde h_{T_{ij}}$
\item A transformed set of points $\mathcal{\tilde P}$ is formed by
  setting $\tilde{\vec{p}}_i = \vec{p}_{u_i}$
\item A mapping $\vec{H}$ between connections (as opposed to points)
  is formed by 
\item A transformed set of connections is formed by setting
  $C'_{ij} = \tilde h_{C_{ij}}$. A number of the rows of this
  matrix contain identical elements to each other. A mapping
  $\tilde{\vec{H}}$ from the rows of this matrix onto one with only
  distinct rows is formed. This is analogous to $\vec{h}$. In an
  Mappings $\tilde{\vec{H}}$ and $\tilde{\vec{U}}$ are formed
  analogously to $\vec{h}$ and $\vec{u}$.
\item The final connection matrix $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$ is formed using
  $\vec{U}$ and $\mathbf{C}'$: $\tilde C_{ij} = C'_{U_ij}$. The number
  of rows in $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$ is $\tilde M$.
\item New $\tilde L_k = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{H}_k|}
  \sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_k} L_i$ where $\mathcal{H}_k = i: k=H_k$. 
\item In order to compute derivatives efficiently later on in the
  prodecdure, a we form a $\tilde N$ by $2\tilde M$ matrix
  $\tilde{\mathbf{B}}$ which maps by setting $\tilde B_{\tilde
    C_{k1}k} = 1$ and $\tilde B_{\tilde C_{k2}k} = 1$ for all
  $k=1\dots \tilde M$.
\end{itemize}

The total area $A$ of the retina is computed by summing the areas of
individual triangles:
\begin{displaymath}
  A = \sum_{i=1}^M a_i
\end{displaymath}
where $a_i = | a_i^\mathrm{sign}|$.  It is supposed that this grid is
to be projected onto a sphere with a radius appropriate for the area
$A$ of the flattened retina. The radius is
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-sphere:eq:1}
  R = \sqrt{\frac{A}{2\pi\sin\phi_0+1}}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_0$ is the latitude at which the rim of the intact retina
would be expected.

The aim now is to infer the latitude $\phi_i$ and longitude
$\lambda_i$ on the sphere to which each grid point $i$ on the
flattened retina is projected.  It is proposed to achieve this aim by
minimising an energy function which depends on three components, an
elastic component $E_\mathrm{E}$ and an area-preserving component
$E_\mathrm{A}$:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  E(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_N,\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_N) = & \\
  E_\mathrm{E}(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_N,\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_N) 
  & + E_\mathrm{A}(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_N,\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_N) 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The elastic energy}
\label{fold-sphere:sec:elastic-force}

This component of the energy corresponds to the energy contained in
imageinary springs with the natural lenght of the distances in the
flattened retina, $\tilde L_k$:
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{fold-sphere:eq:5}
%   \EE  = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N C_{ij} (l_{ij}-L_{ij})^2  
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-sphere:eq:5}
  \EE  = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{\tilde M} \frac{(\tilde l_k- \tilde
    L_k)^2}{\tilde L_k}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde l_k$ is the distance of the $k$th edge between grid points on
the sphere and is given by the formula for the central angle:
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-sphere:eq:2}
  \tilde l_k = R\cos^{-1}(\cos\phi_i\cos\phi_j\cos(\lambda_i-\lambda_j) + \sin\phi_i\sin\phi_j)
\end{equation}
where $i=\tilde C_{k1}$ and $j=\tilde C_{k2}$.  Minimising this energy function
should lead to the distances between neighbouring points on the sphere
being similar to the corresponding distances on the flattened retina.

In order to minimise the function efficiently, the derivatives with
respect to $\phi_i$ and $\lambda_i$ are found:
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-sphere:eq:3}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial \EE}{\partial\phi_i} = 
    \sum_j C_{ij} (l_{ij} - L_{ij})R
    \frac{\sin\phi_i\cos\phi_j\cos(\lambda_i-\lambda_j) - \cos\phi_i\sin\phi_j}
    {\sqrt{1-(\sin\phi_i\sin\phi_j +
        \cos\phi_i\cos\phi_j\cos(\lambda_i-\lambda_j))^2}} \\
    \frac{\partial \EE}{\partial\lambda_i} = 
    \sum_j C_{ij} (l_{ij} - L_{ij})R
    \frac{\cos\phi_i\cos\phi_j\sin(\lambda_i-\lambda_j)}
    {\sqrt{1-(\sin\phi_i\sin\phi_j + \cos\phi_i\cos\phi_j\cos(\lambda_i-\lambda_j))^2}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
A quasi-Newton-Raphson method is then used in R to achieve this
optimisation, and the resulting grid on the sphere is plotted in 3D
(Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:test2}).

\subsection{The area-preserving energy}
\label{fold-sphere:sec:area-pres-energy}



\section{Discussion}
\label{fold-retina:sec:discussion}

Figures~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:test1} and~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:test2}
show that the algorithm does project the flattened retina onto a
sphere. The edges of the retina at the outer ends of tears are closer
together on the sphere than they are in the flattened coordinate
system. However, towards the base of the tears, there is considerable
overlap between neighbouring ``flaps'' of the flattened retina. The
algorithm as it stands is therefore not sufficient to allocate every
point on the flattened retina a coordinate in the presumed sphere of
the intact retina.

The reason for these overlaps is that there is no component of the
energy function that prevents them occurring. I envisage that it would
be possible to put in a component of the energy function that provides
for short range repulsion between vertices on the edge of the
flattened retina and edges of the flattened retina. The energy
function might have longer range attraction. One possible
parametrisation would be the Lennard-Jones potential which is used to
model short range repulsion and longer range attraction between
molecules:
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-sphere:eq:4}
  E(r) = 4\epsilon\left(\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-
    \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6}\right)
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the distance between molecules, $\epsilon$ defines the
depth of the potential well and $\sigma$ is the distance at which the
potential is zero.

A useful preliminary step before implementing this would be to improve
the algorithm that creates the triangular mesh over the flattened
retina, so that it completely fills the space by making links to the
edge of the retina and by laying links along the edge of the retina.

Were this approach to work, additional refinements might be possible,
such as adding a component of the energy function that draws together
points on either side of a rip which are correspond to each other with
high probability. Another possibility would be to allow the radius of
the sphere $R$ to vary within realistic bounds, to optimise the fit
further.
