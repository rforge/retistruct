\opening{Dear Professor Bourne,}

We are submitting for your consideration a manuscript ``Standard
anatomical and visual space for the mouse retina: transformational
strategies for flattened retinae''.  In this study we develop a new
computational technique that allows for the virtual reconstruction of
flat-mounted retinae, which allows the orginal location of labels in
flat-mounted retinae to be determined. The correspondence between the
retina and visual space can then be inferred. We apply this technique
to two problems of biological significance: (1)~testing the
prediction of whether the ipsilateral decussation line corresponds to
the vertical meridian; (2)~the correspondence of cells expressing
s-opsin with visual space. Beyond these applications, we expect that
the method will have a number of applications in visual neuroscience.

We look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}

\end{letter}
