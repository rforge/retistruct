\opening{Dear Professor Bourne,}

We are submitting for your consideration a manuscript ``Standard
anatomical and visual space for the mouse retina: computational
reconstruction and transformation of flattened retinae''. Flat-mount
preparations of retinae are used extensively in studies of the
development and function of the visual system, but comparisons between
different eyes are complicated by the variability of the incisions and
tears inherent in the dissections. The manuscript describes our new
algorithm to reconstruct flat-mounted retinae by morphing them onto a
standard retina, which allows flat-mounted retinae from multiple eyes
to be compared.

Furthermore, we determine the transformation from retinal to visual
space. We apply retinal reconstruction and transformation to two
problems of biological significance: (1)~testing the prediction of
whether the ipsilateral decussation line corresponds to the vertical
meridian; (2)~the correspondence of cells expressing S-opsin with
visual space. Beyond these applications, we expect that the method
will have a number of applications in visual neuroscience.

The code that implements the algorithm is being made available for the
reviewers as supplemental information, and if this manuscript is
accepted we will make it available in the R-Forge repository, as
indicated in the manuscript.

We look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}

\end{letter}
