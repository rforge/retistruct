\section*{Abstract}

% In retrograde tracing experiments to determine the mapping of
%   connections from the retina to the superior colliculus in mice, a
%   small blob of dye is injected in the superior colliculus and allowed
%   to diffuse retrogradely down the axons of retinal ganglion cells to
%   their cell bodies in the retina. 

In the course of studying the function and development of the visual
system cells in the retina are often labelled, for example to
determine the distribution of particular categories of cell in the
retina, to assess the location of retrograde tracer or to measure the
distribution of a guidance molecule.  Following labelling the retina
is dissected and flattened, and the distribution of labels is measured
in the flattened retina.  In the process of flattening the retina, a
number incisions are made, complicating analysis as some cells that
were close neigbours are now separated by the incisions.  

We present a computational method that overcomes this problem by
inferring where the labels were in the intact retina before
flattening. The input to the algorithm is the line segments of the
flattened retinal outline with incisions and tears marked up by an
expert. The retinal outline is split into triangular elements whose
positions are then transformed so that they lie on a partial sphere
with the expected dimensions of the intact retina.  The transformation
is adjusted so as to minimise the change in the dimensions of each
triangle from the flattened outline.

The algorithm is able to produce a transformation which is
sufficiently good for visualisation. \todo{More about validation} 

We demonstrate the application of the method in a number of
situations. \todo{More about applications here.}

\subsection*{Reconstruction algorithm}
\label{retistruct_plos:sec:reconstr-algor}

The reconstruction algorithm described here has been implemented in R
(http://www.r-project.org) and can be downloaded as an R package from
http://www.neuralmapformation.org/code/retistruct. It has been tested
under a GNU/Linux platform but should also work in MacOS or Windows
environments.

The steps of the reconstruction algorithm are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}. The raw data
(Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}A) consists of the sequence of
points making up the outline, sets of data points and sequences of
connected points defining landmarks, such as the optic disk. The
reconstruction process then proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The location of one of the poles and incisions and tears in the
  outline are marked up by an expert
  (Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}B). Each tear is defined by a
  central point, referred to as the apex, and two outer points,
  referred to as vertices.  Tears within tears or incisions (for
  example tear 2 in Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}B) can be
  marked up. The Retistruct package contains a graphical user
  interface to allow incisions and tears to be marked up quickly.
\item The retinal outline is triangulated using the conforming
  Delaunay triangulation algorithm provided by the Triangle package
  \cite{shewchuk96b} such that there are at least 500 triangles in
  the outline (grey lines in Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}C).
\item The tears and incisions are stitched automatically (blue and
  green lines in Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}D). To do this,
  the length of each side of every tear is computed. The fractional
  distance of each point in each tear is then defined as the distance
  along the tear of that point from the apex divided by the total
  length of that side of the tear. For each point on one side of a
  tear a point is inserted at the same fractional distance along the
  opposing side. Tears within tears are dealt with by excluding the
  child tear when computing the fractional distance. At the end of the
  procedure there is a set of correspondences between two or, in the
  case of the vertices of a child tear, three points.
\item There is then an extra round of triangulation to incorporate the
  points that have been inserted into incisions and tears.
\item The points within each set of correspondences are merged and
  allocated positions on the 2D surface.
\item The triangulation points are then projected roughly onto a
  sphere curtailed at latitude of $\phi_0$
  (Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}D). The latitude is estimated
  on the basis of measurements from intact retinae of animals of the
 same age as the retina under reconstruction. The radius $R$ of the
  sphere determined by area of the flattened retina and $\phi_0$.
  Points on the rim of flattened retina are fixed to the rim of the
  curtailed sphere. 
\item The optimal projection onto sphere
  (Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}E) is inferred by changing
  location of vertices on sphere so as to minimise an error
  measure. This measure, $E$, comprises the sum of normalised squared
  differences between lengths of corresponding connections in
  flattened and spherical retina and a penalty term that prevents the
  triangles from flipping over:
  \begin{equation}
    E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i\in\mathcal{C}} \frac{(l_i - L_i)^2}{L_i}  
    + \alpha\sum_{j\in\mathcal{T}} f(a_j/A_j)
  \end{equation}
  where $L_i$ and $l_i$ are lengths of corresponding connections
  $i\in\mathcal{C}$ in the flattened and spherical retina
  respectively, $\alpha$ is a constant, $f$ is a penalty function to
  be defined below and $A_j$ and $a_j$ are signed areas of
  corresponding triangles $j\in\mathcal{T}$ in the flattened and
  spherical retina.  The signed area $a_i$ is positive for triangles in
  correct orientation, but negative for flipped triangles. The penalty
  function $f$ is a piecewise, smooth function that increases steeply
  with negative arguments:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{retistruct_plos:eq:1}
    f(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
          -(x - x_0/2) & x < 0 \\
          \frac{1}{2x_0}(x - x_0)^2 & 0 < x <x_0 \\
          0 & x \ge x_0
          \end{array} \right.
  \end{equation}
  The parameter $x_0$ is set at 0.1. There is thus no penalty unless
  triangles have been squashed to less than 10\% of their size in the
  flattened retina.  The parameter $\alpha$ is set to be large enough
  to prevent flipped triangles without causing numerical problems with
  the optimisation. The length of each edge $l_i$ is computed from the
  formula for the central angle between its vertices:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{retistruct_plos:eq:2}
    l(\phi_1, \lambda_1, \phi_2, \lambda_2) =
    R\cos\phi_1\cos\phi_2\cos(\lambda_1-\lambda_2) +
    \sin\phi_1\sin\phi_2   
  \end{equation}
  where $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are the latitudes of the vertices and
  $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2)$ are the longitudes.  The derivatives of
  $E$ with respect to $\phi_i$ and $\lambda_i$ are computed and the
  BFGS quasi-Newton method implemented in the R optim function is used
  to minimise $E$.
\item The locations of data points and landmarks on the sphere are
  determined (Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}F). To do this, for
  each data point the its barycentric coordinates within its containing
  triangle in the flat representation are determined.  The location of
  the point on the sphere is then found by projecting the point to the
  same set of barycentric coordinates in the corresponding triangle on
  the sphere. From this location in Cartesian 3D space, the spherical
  coordinates of the point are determined by projection of a line from
  the centre of the sphere through the point to the line's
  intersection with the sphere. This allows plotting of points in a
  polar representation. The procedure can be used in reverse to infer
  the locations of lines of latitude and longitude in the flat
  retina.
\item The Karcher mean of each set of points is determined
  (Figure~\ref{fold-sphere:fig:method}F). The Karcher mean of a set of
  points on the sphere \cite{Karc77riem,HeoSmal06form} is defined as
  the point $(\overline{\phi}, \overline{\lambda})$ that has a minimal
  sum of squared distances to the set of points $(\phi_i, \lambda_i)$:
  %% See also BergWerm06
  \begin{equation}
    \label{retistruct_plos:eq:3}
    (\overline{\phi}, \overline{\lambda}) = \mbox{arg min}_{(\phi,
      \lambda)} \sum_{i=1}^N l^2(\phi, \lambda, \phi_i, \lambda_i)
  \end{equation}
  where the function $l$ is defined in
  Equation~(\ref{retistruct_plos:eq:2}).
\end{enumerate}

The procedure of reconstructing a retina takes a few minutes on a
modern desktop computer.
