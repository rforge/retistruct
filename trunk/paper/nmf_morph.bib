  abstract     = {One hundred fifty years ago glial cells were
                  discovered as a second, non-neuronal, cell type in
                  the central nervous system. To ascribe a function to
                  these new, enigmatic cells, it was suggested that
                  they either glue the neurons together (the Greek
                  word “γλια” means “glue”) or provide a robust
                  scaffold for them (“support cells”). Although both
                  speculations are still widely accepted, they would
                  actually require quite different mechanical cell
                  properties, and neither one has ever been confirmed
                  experimentally. We investigated the biomechanics of
                  CNS tissue and acutely isolated individual neurons
                  and glial cells from mammalian brain (hippocampus)
                  and retina. Scanning force microscopy, bulk
                  rheology, and optically induced deformation were
                  used to determine their viscoelastic
                  characteristics. We found that (i) in all CNS cells
                  the elastic behavior dominates over the viscous
                  behavior, (ii) in distinct cell compartments, such
                  as soma and cell processes, the mechanical
                  properties differ, most likely because of the
                  unequal local distribution of cell organelles, (iii)
                  in comparison to most other eukaryotic cells, both
                  neurons and glial cells are very soft (“rubber
                  elastic”), and (iv) intriguingly, glial cells are
                  even softer than their neighboring neurons. Our
                  results indicate that glial cells can neither serve
                  as structural support cells (as they are too soft)
                  nor as glue (because restoring forces are dominant)
                  for neurons. Nevertheless, from a structural
                  perspective they might act as soft, compliant
                  embedding for neurons, protecting them in case of
                  mechanical trauma, and also as a soft substrate
                  required for neurite growth and facilitating
                  neuronal plasticity.},
