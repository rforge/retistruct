                  pigments for the detection of light and visual
                  signaling in cones. Here, we show that S opsin
                  transcription is higher than that of M opsin, which
                  supports ultraviolet ({UV}) sensitivity greater than
                  midwavelength sensitivity. Surprisingly, most cones
                  coexpress both S and M opsins in a common cone cell
                  type throughout the retina. All cones express M
                  opsin, but the levels are graded from dorsal to
                  ventral. The levels of S opsin are relatively
                  constant. However, in the far dorsal retina, S opsin
                  is repressed stochastically, such that some cones
                  express M opsin only. These observations indicate
                  that two different mechanisms control M and S opsin
                  expression. We suggest that a common cone type is
                  patterned across the retinal surface to produce
                  phenotypic cone subtypes.},

  abstract     = {Retinal ganglion cells ({RGCs}) project axons from
                  their cell bodies in the eye to targets in the
                  superior colliculus of the midbrain. The wiring of
                  these axons to their synaptic targets creates an
                  ordered representation, or "map," of retinal space
                  within the brain. Many lines of experiments have
                  demonstrated that the development of this map
                  requires complementary gradients of {EphA} receptor
                  tyrosine kinases and their {ephrin-A} ligands, yet
                  basic features of {EphA} signaling during mapping
                  remain to be resolved. These include the individual
                  roles played by the multiple {EphA} receptors that
                  make up the retinal {EphA} gradient. We have
                  developed a set of ratiometric "relative signaling"
                  ({RS}) rules that quantitatively predict how the
                  composite low-nasal-to-high-temporal {EphA} gradient
                  is translated into topographic order among {RGCs}. A
                  key feature of these rules is that the component
                  receptors of the gradient-in the mouse, {EphA4},
                  {EphA5}, and {EphA6}-must be functionally equivalent
                  and interchangeable. To test this aspect of the
                  model, we generated compound mutant mice in which
                  the periodicity, slope, and receptor composition of
                  the gradient are systematically altered with respect
                  to the levels of {EphA4}, {EphA5}, and a closely
                  related receptor, {EphA3}, that we ectopically
                  express. Analysis of the retinotopic maps of these
                  new mouse mutants establishes the general utility of
                  the {RS} rules for predicting retinocollicular
                  topography, and demonstrates that individual {EphA}
                  gene products are approximately equivalent with
                  respect to axon guidance and target selection.},

                  ganglion cell (RGC) axon pathfinding within the
                  retina to the optic disc, the molecular basis of
                  which is not well understood. At CNS targets,
                  interactions between Eph receptor tyrosine kinases
                  on RGC axons and ephrin ligands on target cells have
                  been implicated in formation of topographic
                  maps. However, studies in chick and mouse have shown
                  that both Eph receptors and ephrins are also
                  expressed within the retina itself, raising the
                  possibility that this receptor-ligand family
                  mediates aspects of retinal development. Here, we
                  more fully document the presence of specific EphB
                  receptors and B-ephrins in embryonic mouse retina
                  and provide evidence that EphB receptors are
                  involved in RGC axon pathfinding to the optic
                  disc. We find that as RGC axons begin this
                  pathfinding process, EphB receptors are uniformly
                  expressed along the dorsal-ventral retinal
                  axis. This is in contrast to the previously reported
                  high ventral-low dorsal gradient of EphB receptors
                  later in development when RGC axons map to CNS
                  targets. We show that mice lacking both EphB2 and
                  EphB3 receptor tyrosine kinases, but not each alone,
                  exhibit increased frequency of RGC axon guidance
                  errors to the optic disc. In these animals, major
                  aspects of retinal development and cellular
                  organization appear normal, as do the expression of
                  other RGC guidance cues netrin, DCC, and
                  L1. Unexpectedly, errors occur in dorsal but not
                  ventral retina despite early uniform or later high
                  ventral expression of EphB2 and EphB3. Furthermore,
                  embryos lacking EphB3 and the kinase domain of EphB2
                  do not show increased errors, consistent with a
                  guidance role for the EphB2 extracellular
                  domain. Thus, while Eph kinase function is involved
                  in RGC axon mapping in the brain, RGC axon
                  pathfinding within the retina is partially mediated
                  by EphB receptors acting in a kinase-independent
                  manner.},

                  neuronal connections are a key feature of brain
                  organization. Such maps are believed to develop in
                  response to complementary position-specific labels
                  in presynaptic and postsynaptic fields. However, the
                  complementary labeling molecules are not known. In
                  the well-studied visual map of retinal axons
                  projecting to the tectum, the labels are
                  hypothesized to be in gradients, without needing
                  large numbers of cell-specific molecules. We
                  recently cloned {ELF}-1 as a ligand for Eph family
                  receptors. Here, {RNA} hybridization shows matching
                  expression gradients for {ELF}-1 in the tectum and
                  its receptor Mek4 in the retina. Binding activity
                  detected with alkaline phosphatase fusions of
                  {ELF}-1 and Mek4 also reveals gradients and provides
                  direct evidence for molecular complementarity of
                  gradients in reciprocal fields. {ELF}-1 and Mek4 may
                  therefore play roles in retinotectal development and

                  retina was studied with the use of Nissl criteria
                  for distinguishing cell types in the ganglion cell
                  layer. Retrograde filling with horseradish
                  peroxidase (HRP) from the optic fiber tract helped
                  to validate Nissl criteria and served to identify
                  displaced ganglion cells. We estimated a total of
                  117,000 nonvascular cells in the ganglion cell
                  layer; of these, 70,000 were probably ganglion
                  cells, and 47,000 could not be classified. The
                  density of the presumed ganglion cells was
                  highest-more than 8000 cells/mm2-just temporal to
                  the optic disk, and lowest-less than 2000
                  cells/mm2-in the most dorsal retina. The retinal
                  region with highest ganglion cell density was
                  slightly elongated in a nasotemporal
                  direction. About 2% of all HRP-filled ganglion cells
                  had their cell bodies in the inner nuclear
                  layer. These displaced cells differed in
                  topographical distribution from the normally
                  positioned ganglion cells: although occurring
                  throughout the retina, they were more common along
                  the retinal periphery. Measurements of ganglion cell
                  areas showed a tendency toward larger size with
                  eccentricity. At no retinal location did cell-size
                  histograms reveal clearly separate size classes.},

                  by molecular guidance cues and refined by neuronal
                  activity. Retinal input to a primary visual center,
                  the superior colliculus (SC), is bilateral with a
                  dense contralateral projection and a sparse
                  ipsilateral one. Both projections are
                  topographically organized, but in opposing
                  anterior-posterior orientations. This arrangement
                  provides functionally coherent input to each
                  colliculus from the binocular visual field,
                  supporting visual function. When guidance cues
                  involved in contralateral topography (ephrin-As) are
                  absent, crossed retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons
                  form inappropriate terminations within the
                  SC. However, the organization of the ipsilateral
                  projection relative to the abnormal contralateral
                  input remains unknown, as does the functional
                  capacity of both projections. We show here that in
                  ephrin-A(-/-) mice, the SC contains an expanded,
                  diffuse ipsilateral projection. Electrophysiological
                  recording demonstrated that topography of visually
                  evoked responses recorded from the contralateral
                  superior colliculus of ephrin-A(-/-) mice displayed
                  similar functional disorder in all genotypes,
                  contrasting with their different degrees of
                  anatomical disorder. In contrast, ipsilateral
                  responses were retinotopic in ephrin-A2(-/-) but
                  disorganized in ephrin-A2/A5(-/-) mice. The lack of
                  integration of binocular input resulted in specific
                  visual deficits, which could be reversed by
                  occlusion of one eye. The discrepancy between
                  anatomical and functional topography in both the
                  ipsilateral and contralateral projections implies
                  suppression of inappropriately located
                  terminals. Moreover, the misalignment of ipsilateral
                  and contralateral visual information in
                  ephrin-A2/A5(-/-) mice suggests a role for ephrin-As
                  in integrating convergent visual inputs.},

  abstract     = {Humans and old world primates have trichromatic
                  color vision based on three spectral types of cone
                  [long-wavelength (L-), middle-wavelength (M-), and
                  short-wavelength (S-) cones]. All other placental
                  mammals are dichromats, and their color vision
                  depends on the comparison of L- and S-cone signals;
                  however, their cone-selective retinal circuitry is
                  still unknown. Here, we identified the
                  S-cone-selective (blue cone) bipolar cells of the
                  mouse retina. They were labeled in a transgenic
                  mouse expressing Clomeleon, a chloride-sensitive
                  fluorescent protein, under the control of the thy1
                  promoter. Blue-cone bipolar cells comprise only
                  1-2\% of the bipolar cell population, and their
                  dendrites selectively contact S-opsin-expressing
                  cones. In the dorsal half of the mouse retina, only
                  3-5\% of the cones express S-opsin, and they are all
                  contacted by blue-cone bipolar cells, whereas all
                  L-opsin-expressing cones (approximately 95\%) are
                  avoided. In the ventral mouse retina, the great
                  majority of cones express both S- and L-opsin. They
                  are not contacted by blue-cone bipolar cells. A
                  minority of ventral cones express S-opsin only, and
                  they are selectively contacted by blue-cone bipolar
                  cells. We suggest that these are genuine S-cones. In
                  contrast to the other cones, their pedicles contain
                  only low amounts of cone arrestin. The blue-cone
                  bipolar cells of the mouse retina and their cone
                  selectivity are closely similar to primate blue-cone
                  bipolars, and we suggest that they both represent
                  the phylogenetically ancient color system of the
                  mammalian retina.},

  abstract     = { Our understanding of how mammalian sensory circuits
                  are organized and develop has long been hindered by
                  the lack of genetic markers of neurons with discrete
                  functions. Here, we report a transgenic mouse
                  selectively expressing {GFP} in a complete mosaic of
                  transient {OFF}-alpha retinal ganglion cells
                  ({tOFF}-{alphaRGCs}). This enabled us to relate the
                  mosaic spacing, dendritic anatomy, and
                  electrophysiology of these {RGCs} to their complete
                  map of projections in the brain. We find that
                  {tOFF}-{alphaRGCs} project exclusively to the
                  superior colliculus ({SC}) and dorsal lateral
                  geniculate nucleus and are restricted to a specific
                  laminar depth within each of these targets. The
                  axons of {tOFF}-{alphaRGC} are also organized into
                  columns in the {SC}. Both laminar and columnar
                  specificity develop through axon
                  refinement. Disruption of cholinergic retinal waves
                  prevents the emergence of columnar- but not
                  laminar-specific {tOFF}-{alphaRGC} connections. Our
                  findings reveal that in a genetically identified
                  sensory map, spontaneous activity promotes synaptic
                  specificity by segregating axons arising from {RGCs}
                  of the same subtype.  },

                  speculations are still widely accepted, they would
                  actually require quite different mechanical cell
                  properties, and neither one has ever been confirmed
                  experimentally. We investigated the biomechanics of
                  CNS tissue and acutely isolated individual neurons
                  and glial cells from mammalian brain (hippocampus)
                  and retina. Scanning force microscopy, bulk
                  rheology, and optically induced deformation were
                  used to determine their viscoelastic
                  characteristics. We found that (i) in all CNS cells
                  the elastic behavior dominates over the viscous
                  behavior, (ii) in distinct cell compartments, such
                  as soma and cell processes, the mechanical
                  properties differ, most likely because of the
                  unequal local distribution of cell organelles, (iii)
                  in comparison to most other eukaryotic cells, both
                  neurons and glial cells are very soft (“rubber
                  elastic”), and (iv) intriguingly, glial cells are
                  even softer than their neighboring neurons. Our
                  results indicate that glial cells can neither serve
                  as structural support cells (as they are too soft)
                  nor as glue (because restoring forces are dominant)
                  for neurons. Nevertheless, from a structural
                  perspective they might act as soft, compliant
                  embedding for neurons, protecting them in case of
                  mechanical trauma, and also as a soft substrate
                  required for neurite growth and facilitating
                  neuronal plasticity.},

@Article{MarcEtal96eph,
  abstract     = {The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and
                  their ligands can be divided into two specificity
                  subclasses: the Eck-related receptors and their
                  {GPI}-anchored ligands, and the Elk-related
                  receptors and their transmembrane ligands. Previous
                  reports demonstrated that Eck- and Elk-related
                  receptors in the retina distribute in high
                  temporal-low nasal and high ventral-low dorsal
                  gradients, respectively. While others have focused
                  on complementary ligand gradients in the retinal
                  axon target, the tectum, we report that ligands from
                  each subclass also distribute in gradients opposing
                  those of their corresponding receptors within the
                  retina itself. Moreover, ligand gradients in the
                  retina precede ganglion cell genesis. These results
                  support an intraretinal role for Eph family members
                  in addition to their previously proposed role in the
                  development of retinotectal topography. The distinct
                  distributions of Eph family members suggest that
                  each subclass specifies positional information along
                  independent retinal axes.},

                  (RGC) neurons in the eye to their synaptic targets
                  in the superior colliculus of the midbrain has long
                  served as the dominant experimental system for the
                  analysis of topographic neural maps. Here we
                  describe a quantitative model for the development of
                  one arm of this map--the wiring of the
                  nasal-temporal axis of the retina to the
                  caudal-rostral axis of the superior colliculus. The
                  model is based on RGC-RGC competition that is
                  governed by comparisons of EphA receptor signalling
                  intensity, which are made using ratios of, rather
                  than absolute differences in, EphA signalling
                  between RGCs. Molecular genetic experiments,
                  exploiting a combinatorial series of EphA receptor
                  knock-in and knockout mice, confirm the salient
                  predictions of the model, and show that it both

                  localized to two opposite halves of the eye. One
                  cone type was labelled by the monoclonal antibody
                  {COS}-1 specific to the middle-to-long wave
                  sensitive visual pigment of the mammals, while the
                  other type was stained by the shortwave-specific
                  monoclonal antibody ({OS}-2). These results were
                  confirmed with other antibodies directed against
                  specific sequences of the visual pigments. As a
                  result of the uneven distribution of the two cone
                  types the mouse retina is divided into two fields
                  separated by an oblique meridional line. The
                  middlewave sensitive cones were present exclusively
                  in the dorsal half of the mouse retina
                  (M-field). The overwhelming majority of the
                  shortwave sensitive cones occupied the ventral half
                  (S-field), and only a small number was scattered
                  among the middlewave sensitive cones in the dorsal
                  retina. The ratio of the two cone types in the
                  M-field corresponds to what has been found in the
                  retina of other mammals, including rodents such as
                  the gerbil and the rat. The S-field represents an
                  entirely unique area with the unusually great number
                  of shortwave sensitive cones and with the complete
                  lack of the middlewave sensitive ones. The present
                  study provides the structural basis for dichromacy
                  in a rodent species considered for a long time to be
                  monochromat. In addition, it shows that the ventral
                  retina, containing exclusively S-cones in a
                  relatively high density, is a unique retinal field
                  not present in other mammalian species studied so
                  far.  },
