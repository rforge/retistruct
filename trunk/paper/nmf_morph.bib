  abstract     = {Retinal ganglion cells ({RGCs}) project axons from
                  their cell bodies in the eye to targets in the
                  superior colliculus of the midbrain. The wiring of
                  these axons to their synaptic targets creates an
                  ordered representation, or "map," of retinal space
                  within the brain. Many lines of experiments have
                  demonstrated that the development of this map
                  requires complementary gradients of {EphA} receptor
                  tyrosine kinases and their {ephrin-A} ligands, yet
                  basic features of {EphA} signaling during mapping
                  remain to be resolved. These include the individual
                  roles played by the multiple {EphA} receptors that
                  make up the retinal {EphA} gradient. We have
                  developed a set of ratiometric "relative signaling"
                  ({RS}) rules that quantitatively predict how the
                  composite low-nasal-to-high-temporal {EphA} gradient
                  is translated into topographic order among {RGCs}. A
                  key feature of these rules is that the component
                  receptors of the gradient-in the mouse, {EphA4},
                  {EphA5}, and {EphA6}-must be functionally equivalent
                  and interchangeable. To test this aspect of the
                  model, we generated compound mutant mice in which
                  the periodicity, slope, and receptor composition of
                  the gradient are systematically altered with respect
                  to the levels of {EphA4}, {EphA5}, and a closely
                  related receptor, {EphA3}, that we ectopically
                  express. Analysis of the retinotopic maps of these
                  new mouse mutants establishes the general utility of
                  the {RS} rules for predicting retinocollicular
                  topography, and demonstrates that individual {EphA}
                  gene products are approximately equivalent with
                  respect to axon guidance and target selection.},

                  neuronal connections are a key feature of brain
                  organization. Such maps are believed to develop in
                  response to complementary position-specific labels
                  in presynaptic and postsynaptic fields. However, the
                  complementary labeling molecules are not known. In
                  the well-studied visual map of retinal axons
                  projecting to the tectum, the labels are
                  hypothesized to be in gradients, without needing
                  large numbers of cell-specific molecules. We
                  recently cloned {ELF}-1 as a ligand for Eph family
                  receptors. Here, {RNA} hybridization shows matching
                  expression gradients for {ELF}-1 in the tectum and
                  its receptor Mek4 in the retina. Binding activity
                  detected with alkaline phosphatase fusions of
                  {ELF}-1 and Mek4 also reveals gradients and provides
                  direct evidence for molecular complementarity of
                  gradients in reciprocal fields. {ELF}-1 and Mek4 may
                  therefore play roles in retinotectal development and

                  ganglion cell (RGC) axon pathfinding within the
                  retina to the optic disc, the molecular basis of
                  which is not well understood. At CNS targets,
                  interactions between Eph receptor tyrosine kinases
                  on RGC axons and ephrin ligands on target cells have
                  been implicated in formation of topographic
                  maps. However, studies in chick and mouse have shown
                  that both Eph receptors and ephrins are also
                  expressed within the retina itself, raising the
                  possibility that this receptor-ligand family
                  mediates aspects of retinal development. Here, we
                  more fully document the presence of specific EphB
                  receptors and B-ephrins in embryonic mouse retina
                  and provide evidence that EphB receptors are
                  involved in RGC axon pathfinding to the optic
                  disc. We find that as RGC axons begin this
                  pathfinding process, EphB receptors are uniformly
                  expressed along the dorsal-ventral retinal
                  axis. This is in contrast to the previously reported
                  high ventral-low dorsal gradient of EphB receptors
                  later in development when RGC axons map to CNS
                  targets. We show that mice lacking both EphB2 and
                  EphB3 receptor tyrosine kinases, but not each alone,
                  exhibit increased frequency of RGC axon guidance
                  errors to the optic disc. In these animals, major
                  aspects of retinal development and cellular
                  organization appear normal, as do the expression of
                  other RGC guidance cues netrin, DCC, and
                  L1. Unexpectedly, errors occur in dorsal but not
                  ventral retina despite early uniform or later high
                  ventral expression of EphB2 and EphB3. Furthermore,
                  embryos lacking EphB3 and the kinase domain of EphB2
                  do not show increased errors, consistent with a
                  guidance role for the EphB2 extracellular
                  domain. Thus, while Eph kinase function is involved
                  in RGC axon mapping in the brain, RGC axon
                  pathfinding within the retina is partially mediated
                  by EphB receptors acting in a kinase-independent
                  manner.},

                  discovered as a second, non-neuronal, cell type in
                  the central nervous system. To ascribe a function to
                  these new, enigmatic cells, it was suggested that
                  they either glue the neurons together (the Greek
                  word “γλια” means “glue”) or provide a robust
                  scaffold for them (“support cells”). Although both
                  speculations are still widely accepted, they would
                  actually require quite different mechanical cell
                  properties, and neither one has ever been confirmed
                  experimentally. We investigated the biomechanics of
                  CNS tissue and acutely isolated individual neurons
                  and glial cells from mammalian brain (hippocampus)
                  and retina. Scanning force microscopy, bulk
                  rheology, and optically induced deformation were
                  used to determine their viscoelastic
                  characteristics. We found that (i) in all CNS cells
                  the elastic behavior dominates over the viscous
                  behavior, (ii) in distinct cell compartments, such
                  as soma and cell processes, the mechanical
                  properties differ, most likely because of the
                  unequal local distribution of cell organelles, (iii)
                  in comparison to most other eukaryotic cells, both
                  neurons and glial cells are very soft (“rubber
                  elastic”), and (iv) intriguingly, glial cells are
                  even softer than their neighboring neurons. Our
                  results indicate that glial cells can neither serve
                  as structural support cells (as they are too soft)
                  nor as glue (because restoring forces are dominant)
                  for neurons. Nevertheless, from a structural
                  perspective they might act as soft, compliant
                  embedding for neurons, protecting them in case of
                  mechanical trauma, and also as a soft substrate
                  required for neurite growth and facilitating
                  neuronal plasticity.},

                  caudal-rostral axis of the superior colliculus. The
                  model is based on RGC-RGC competition that is
                  governed by comparisons of EphA receptor signalling
                  intensity, which are made using ratios of, rather
                  than absolute differences in, EphA signalling
                  between RGCs. Molecular genetic experiments,
                  exploiting a combinatorial series of EphA receptor
                  knock-in and knockout mice, confirm the salient
                  predictions of the model, and show that it both
                  describes and predicts topographic mapping.},
