\section{Algorithm}
\label{fold-retina:sec:method}

Consider a partial sphere where location on the surface is defined by
the azimuth angle $\phi$ and angle  $\theta$ from the pole. The part
of the sphere opposite the pole is removed, leaving a rim at an
elevation of $\theta_0$.

A grid is laid over the surface of the sphere.  There are $M$
divisions in the azimuthal direction, each subtending an angle of
$\Delta \phi=2\pi/M$. There are $N$ divisions in t in the azimuthal
directions, each subtending an angle of $\Delta\theta=\theta_0/N$. The
distance of a point $i$ to any of its nearest neighbours $j$ is
defined $L_{ij}$. For the nearest neighbours above and below $L_{ij} =
\Delta\theta$ and in the azimuthal direction is $L_{ij}
=\sin(\theta_i)\Delta \phi$.

It is supposed that this grid is to be projected onto a flattened
retina. First, portions of the original rim of the retina are
identified. At present, this is done by eye, but it may be possible to
automate the procedure. Next the $M$ points corresponding to the rim
of the partial sphere $\vec{p}_i$ are laid out at equal intervals
along the rim of the flattened retina. 

The aim now is to infer the locations $\vec{q}_i$ of the remaining
$m=(M-1)N$ points of the grid.  In furtherance of this aim, an energy
function is defined:
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-retina:eq:1}
  E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m A_{ij} |\vec{q}_i - \vec{q}_j|^2
  + \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^M B_{ij} |\vec{q}_i - \vec{p}_j|^2
\end{equation}
where the elements of the $m$ by $m$ matrix $A$ are defined
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-retina:eq:2}
  A_{ij} =\left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    0       & \mbox{if $i$ and $j$ are not connected in the grid} \\
    1/L_{ij} & \mbox{if $i$ and $j$ are  connected in the grid}
  \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
and the elements of the $m$ by $M$ matrix $B$ is similarly defined.
Minising this energy function should have the effect of minising the
total lengths of the connections and while also making the lengths of
the connections between nearest neigbours on the flattened retina
proportional to the distance between the corresponding connections on
the partial sphere.


We define the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $\vec{q}_i$ as $q_{i1}$ and
$q_{i2}$ respectively. Now
 differentiating Equation~(\ref{fold-retina:eq:1}) with respect to
the elements of the $\vec{q}_i$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-retina:eq:5}
  \frac{\partial E}{\partial q_{i1}} = 
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_j A_{ij} 2(q_{i1} - q_{j1}) 
  +   \frac{1}{2}\sum_j B_{ij} 2(q_{i1} - q_{j1}) 
\end{equation}

and setting it to zero, we can find
the set of points $\vec{q}_i$ that minimise the energy. This can be
written conveniently as a matrix equation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-retina:eq:3}
  Q = (D - A)^{-1}BP
\end{equation}
where the matrices $Q=[ \vec{q}_1 \dots \vec{q}_m]^T$, $P=[ \vec{p}_1
\dots \vec{p}_M]^T$ and $D$ is a $m$ by $m$  diagonal matrix with
\begin{equation}
  \label{fold-retina:eq:4}
  D_{ii} = \sum_j A_{ij} + \sum_j B_{ij}
\end{equation}

\section{Application to retina}
\label{fold-retina:sec:application-retina}

Figures~\ref{fold-retina:fig:map090}--\ref{fold-retina:fig:map140}
show the results of the algorithm applied to one of Dan's flattened
retinae for various values of $\theta_0$ and $\Delta\theta=\Delta\phi=10^\circ$. I've marked up what I think is the original rim of the retina
in red, and distributed 36 points along it, which are considered to be
the fixed points $\vec{p}_i$ of the algorithm.

A mapping is produced, but it is clearly distorted around the tears,
and generally in the elevation ($\theta$) direction.

For a good mapping, the increments along the radial lines would be
expected to be equal, but in fact they are larger towards the rim than
in the cnetre (apart from the most central interval between the pole
and the $\theta=10^\circ$ line of elevation. This effect is less
pronounced as $\theta_0$ is increased towards $140^\circ$
(Figure~\ref{fold-retina:fig:map140}).

In the vicinity of the tears, the mapping is obviously skewed. This is
because the tug of the points on the other side of the tear is from
the wrong direction.

\section{Discussion}
\label{fold-retina:sec:discussion}

The algorithm produces a mapping, but because there is no tear
information in the model, it is a poor one.

Possible ways forward:
\begin{itemize}
\item Try a completely different method (e.g. stiching and tiling).
\item Find some way of dealing with distance across a tear
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is likely to be hard to deal with ananlytically, so use an
  optimisation algorithm such as conjugate gradient to find the minimum.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Exteneded algorithm}
\label{fold-retina:sec:exteneded-algorithm}

The aim now is to infer the locations $\vec{q}_i$ of the remaining
$m=(M-1)N$ points of the grid.  In furtherance of this aim, an energy
function is defined:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m A_{ij} |\vec{q}_i -
    \vec{q}_j|^2
    +  \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^M B_{ij} |\vec{q}_i -
    \vec{p}_j|^2 \\
    + \sum_{k=1}^{n_s} \left(\sum_{i=1}^m  C_{ik}|\vec{q}_i -
      \vec{r}_{ik} - s_k\vec{v}_{ik}|
    \right)^2
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
