Changes in version 0.2 (r462)
=============================

User-facing changes
-------------------

* Almost all bugs preventing marking up retinae and optimisation fixed
  (There are some retinae in which there is an error in segments2pointers())

* Batch mode command which writes a log file in CSV format and produces images

* It is now possible to mark the optic disc, and the distance in
  degrees of the inferred retinal pole from the OD is reported

* Command line version of retistruct

* Revised manual

Algorithm changes
-----------------

* New way of initialising points prior to optimisation

* New  piecewise, error function, which ensures that optimisation
  never crashes due to numbers out of range

* Experimental FEM code written, but not used at present

Internal changes
----------------

* Various simplifications and improvements to the code

Changes in version 0.1 (r317)
=============================

* New, hopefully easier installation method

* Plotting improvements during optimisation

* Fixed bug when specifying dorsal point (Issue #153)

* During optimisation, correct error is now reported (Issue #164)

* Landmarks (i.e. the optic disc an other marks) are now plotted
  (Issue #159)

* Tears now plotted in 3D and polar plots

* Plotting of gridlines has been improved (hopefully)

* The initial mapping has been improved so that there should be no
  flipped triangles at the start of optimisation

* Fix for Issue #169: Failure to read MAP file

* Fix for issue #173: Failure to read map outline

* Plotting of scale on flattened retina plot

* Strain plot added

* Tears are checked to see if they are valid after a move

* Added three-click tear addition

* Saving of iD, iN and phi0 in markup.csv
