Installation of the nmf_morph/retistruct program
================================================

Fedora Linux 
============

1. Install the necessary system packages
----------------------------------------

As root,

yum install R-core
yum install R-devel
yum install gtk2
yum install gtk2-devel
yum install mesa-libGL-devel
yum install mesa-libGLU-devel
yum install subversion # Only required if getting code with svn

2. Obtain the source code
-------------------------

This can be either a tarball or via svn.

I'll provide a tarball that unpacks into a directory called src

To get the code via svn, in *theory* you should be able to do something like:

kinit danial.nedergaard%kcl.ac.uk@FRIEND.ED.AC.UK
svn co https://coltex.inf.ed.ac.uk/reposraw/nmf_morph

Thereafter,

svn update in the tree should get the files.

The required files are in nmf_morph/trunk/src

3. Install the required R pacakges
----------------------------------

Various R contributed packages are needed. To install them:

1. Make sure you're in the src directory
2. Start R, and then type:

   source("install.R")

   After some time, the packages should be installed.

3. Exit R, and type

  ./install

   in the shell. This is required to compile custom C code in the package.

4. Test that it works
---------------------

To start the program:

$ R
> source("retistruct.R")

A window should appear.
