Retistruct
==========

/computational reconstruction and transformation of flattened retinae/

Retistruct is an R package to morph a flat surface with cuts (a
dissected flat-mount retina) onto a curvilinear surface (the a
standard retinal shape). It can estimate the position of a point on
the intact adult retina to within 8° of arc (3.6% of nasotemporal
axis). The coordinates in reconstructed retinae can be transformed to
visuotopic coordinates.
